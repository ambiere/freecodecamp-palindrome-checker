# Palindrome Checker
FreecodeCamp.org Palindrome Checker project 

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Strings with varying formats, such as `racecar`, `RaceCar`, and `race CAR` among others can be passed, and the checker will verify if it is a palindrome. It is also possible to pass strings with special symbols, such as `2A3*3a2`, `2A3 3a2`, and `2_A3*3#A2`.
